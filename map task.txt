Adaptive Current Sensing:
* Low sampling during parking/sleep
* Medium during normal driving
* High during acceleration and fast charge

How SOC Calculated
* EKF (extended kalman filter)
* Update the Qmax at each cycle
* SOC VS OCV
    * after resting Period
    * avoid while Deadband/flat curve OCV
    * OCV implementation
        * Enter Rest Mode - wait 5-15min
        * read the cells voltage and average
        * Temperature Measurement
        * Map Cell Voltage to SOC
        * Consensus SOC Determination
        * Blend or Apply Correction of OCV

How to Measure OCV
* Use HPPC tester device 
	
How To Measure Internal Impedance 
* On lab testing (HPPC tester)
    * 
* With BMS
    * add temperature data as compensation (impedance sensitive to temperature)	
    * detect certain event when bus meet the condition
        * Sudden change in current (e.g., >5 A within 100 ms).
        * Flat temperature (to avoid thermal effects).
        * Small SOC change (to assume constant OCV).
        * Low noise (avoid PWM or switching noise regions).
How estimate range
    * 

How SOH is calculated
    * (impedance, heat growth as battery aged); zBol/zEol
    * Qbol/Qmax (last cycle) (beginning of life)

Simulate Battery Cell & BMS in matlab&simulink
    * Cell Model - make digital twin of the cell characterization (collecting the data like Thevenin method,OCV)
    * Bms Model - check system criticality

SOC Current sensing
    * INA229/AS8510
    * Rshunt 0.1-1uf, Digital Isolated module (INA229)

Cell Voltage sensing
    * LTC

Cell balancing

Internal memory

HPPC Tester
    * Energy meter (discharge to multipoint of SOC need energy meter)
