Adaptive Current Sensing:
* Low sampling during parking/sleep
* Medium during normal driving
* High during acceleration and fast charge

How SOC Calculated
* SOC VS OCV recalibrate the soc with ocv curve while idle state
* avoid OCV update on deadband/flat curve 
* Update the Qmax at each cycle
* OCV implementation:
    * Enter Rest Mode - wait 5-15min
    * Per-Cell Voltage Sampling - read the cell voltage and average
    * Temperature Measurement - Temperature Measurement
    * Mapping Cell Voltage to SOC
    * Consensus SOC Determination
    * Blend or Apply Correction of OCV

How to Measure OCV
	Use HPPC tester device 

How To Measure Internal Impedance 
	add temperature data as compensation (impedance sensitive to temperature)	
	detect certain event when bus meet the condition:
        * Sudden change in current (e.g., >5 A within 100 ms).
        * Flat temperature (to avoid thermal effects).
        * Small SOC change (to assume constant OCV).
        * Low noise (avoid PWM or switching noise regions).

How estimate range
	- 

How SOH is calculated
	- (impedance, heat growth as battery aged); zBol/zEol 
	- Qmax (last cycle)/Qbol (beginning of life)

Simulate Battery Cell & BMS in matlab&simulink
	-Cell Model - make digital twin of the cell characterization (collecting the data like thevenin method,OCV) ask AI for more
	-Bms Model - check system criticality

HPPC Tester
    * During testing the energy meter always calculating
    * After resting periode at certain soc level, discharge to another soc point level and continue testing
